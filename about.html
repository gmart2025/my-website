        About the project
    </h2>
    <p>
        Takes a look into Boston's public transportation systems to determine if Bostonians have equitable access to the T. Uncovers racial and socioeconomic divides to access in public transportation, which relates to bigger issues in fair access to opportunities, necessities, education, and more.

        Abstract
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is crucial to a well functioning and equitable society to allow all people equal access to everyday places like work, schools, grocery stores, and more. With public transportation, which is predominately used in large cities in the United States, people are granted this access, especially if they cannot provide their own transportation. However, public transportation is known to have discrepancies between populations of different races and socioeconomic status. This study aims to analyze these issues as they exist in Boston, Massachusetts, and explore how Boston’s public transportation serves its communities and how it provides access to different populations and neighborhoods. Using multiple MBTA datasets regarding ridership information and T quality, as well as Boston demographic data, this paper gets closer to uncovering the situation in Boston. It finds that the racial and economic gaps do persist in Boston as well, and that the majority of riders are unhappy with their experiences on public transportation. Finally, these findings highlight the need for a reorganization of Boston’s public transportation as well as possible new additions in modes of transportation, free access to the T, and rethinking how to serve the communities who need it the most.

    <h2>
        Findings
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Bus has the highest ridership numbers, serves the minority population the most, and has the highest number of delays as well as severity of delays.</li>
        <li>Overall satisfaction with the MBTA is decreasing.</li>
        <li>Boston’s public transportation system is not keeping up with the needs of Bostonians in everyday life today.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>
        Moving Forward:
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Provide fare-free access to public transportation for all individuals.</li>
        <p>
            This would allow low income individuals better opportunities to travel. If all public transportation in Boston became free, everyone would be able to access every part of the city with more ease.
        </p>
        <li>Restructure, change, or add lines to combat dangerous or insufficient infrastructure.</li>
        <p>
            The city should update all the train cars and buses to ensure a good quality standard and minimize the amount of delays and issues caused by old vehicles Finally, they should implement new lines that can connect previously unconnected neighborhoods, specifically ones of lower income or higher minority percentage to those of higher income and lower minority percentage.

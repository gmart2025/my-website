  <p id="aboutMe">
    I am a current undergraduate student at Northeastern University who has found a passion for data science and its connection with political science! 
    I am originally from New York, but have found much joy in traveling the world. From my three study abroad experiences at Northeastern, hiking glacier 
    Perito Moreno in Argentina and trekking up the Fushimi Inari shrine in Japan have been some of my favorite experiences! I love spending quality time 
    with friends and those close to me, enjoying a coffee, and walking around Boston. I also enjoy shopping and exploring new fashion styles as well as 
    daily pilates workouts! Finally, It's important to me to always continue learning and growing, and have fun while doing it. 
	A passion of mine and something I have always deeply cared about is creating a more equitable society, whether that be just in Boston, across the country, 
  or even across the globe. More specifically, I came to develop a passion for transit equity in U.S. cities after experiencing and reading news about unequal 
  access to public transportation. Because of this I have pursued a research project regarding access to public transit in Boston, which this website will 
  focus on. This matters significantly to me as someone who grew up using NYC subways and relying heavily on them to see family, learn, and grow opportunities. 
  My research thus acts as a call to action for public transportation equity in communities.
